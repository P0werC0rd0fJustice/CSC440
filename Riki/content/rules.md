###Team Rules:
* We use "wiki440" systems page "Wiki_Wack" to share project information among team members.
* We use google docs in order to view and work on things together as a group.
* We will use discord for any and all communications within the group.
* Our time together is limited, so use it wisely.
* Take the meetings seriously.
* If you are unable to make it to a meeting, notify the group leader immediately.
* Stick to the schedule.


###SE Rules:
* KISS
* No Surprises
* Don’t contact your boss’ boss directly. (Go through the team leader instead of directly to Dr. Cho)
* When implementing your feature: buy, don’t build.
* Design before coding.
* Always test everything.
* Use documentation.
